Abstract:

EVEN-IF counterfactuals are discussed with the goal of advocating for a compositional rather than lexical analysis of the phrase. Previous approaches to even are reviewed: one positing multiple homophonous morphemes and another unified approach. Their mean is integrated into the analysis provided in this paper. Finally, a consistent theory of EVEN-IF counterfactuals is provided, replete with specifics on how the presuppositions of even are built from the information of the conditional.
