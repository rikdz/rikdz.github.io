excerpt: '"[Prior] techniques focus on extracting all entities and relations from a document, which for long and dense documents such as scientific papers may be hundreds or thousands. This poses a new challenge: how do we determine the most important entities in a paper and the key relationships between them?"'

Abstract:

Knowledge graphs capture entities and relations from long documents and can facilitate reasoning in many downstream applications. Extracting compact knowledge graphs containing only salient entities and relations is important but challenging for understanding and summarizing long documents. We introduce a new text-to-graph task of predicting summarized knowledge graphs from long documents. We develop a dataset of 200k document/graph pairs using automatic and human annotations. We also develop strong baselines for this task based on graph learning and text summarization, and provide quantitative and qualitative studies of their effect.
